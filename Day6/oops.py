1.Class:
    A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created.
    It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods.

    Classes are created by keyword class.

    Sysntax:

    class ClassName:
   # Statement-1
   .
   .
   .
   # Statement-N

2.Object:
    The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. It may be any real-world object
    like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries,
    are all objects. More specifically,
    any single integer or any single string is an object.

        EX:

            obj = classname()




3.Encapsulation:

    Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP).
    It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit.

    A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc.


4.Polymorphism:
    Polymorphism simply means having many forms. For example, we need to determine if the given species of birds fly or not,
    using polymorphism we can do this using a single function.
    Types :
    1.Compile Time
    2.Run time Polymorphism

5.Inhertance:
    Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.
    The class that derives properties is called the derived class or base class and the class from which
    the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class.

    Types:
    1.Single Inheritance
    2.Multiple Inheritance
    3.Multilevel Inheritance
    4.Hierarchical Inheritance
    5.Hybrid Inheritance

6.Abstraction:
    Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that “shows” only essential attributes and “hides”
    unnecessary information. The main purpose of abstraction
     is hiding the unnecessary details from the users. ... It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs
