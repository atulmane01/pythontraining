1. if else:

    An else statement can be combined with an if statement. An else statement contains the block of code that executes
    if the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a FALSE value.
    a=50
    b=60

    if a==b:
        print("The numbers are identical")
    else:
        print("The Number is Not same ")
2.elif:
    The elif statement allows you to check multiple expressions for TRUE and execute a block of code as soon as one of
    the conditions evaluates to TRUE.
    EX:
        var = 100
        if var == 200:
           print(var)
        elif var == 150:
              print(var)
        elif var == 100:
           print(var)
        else:
           print(var)
